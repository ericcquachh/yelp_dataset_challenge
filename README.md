#yelp_dataset_challenge

One of probably the best entries to the dataset challenge, this project challenges YOU.

Just kidding. Nothing is implemented.

# TODO (note: some of these tasks may be already completed)

1) Filter out relevant stop words (done)
2) Perform TF-IDF (done)
3) Partition the reviews and extract the text from each review (in progress)
4) Perform Sentiment Analysis on the reviews (in progress)
5) Build a classifier (in progress)
