Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. 

Looking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. 

Good grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer.
