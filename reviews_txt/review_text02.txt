Dr. Goldberg has been my doctor for years and I like him.  I've found his office to be fairly efficient.  Today I actually got to see the doctor a few minutes early!  

He seems very engaged with his patients and his demeanor is friendly, yet authoritative.    

I'm glad to have Dr. Goldberg as my doctor.
