This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.
