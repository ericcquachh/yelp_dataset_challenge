I love Dr. Goldberg. Best doctor I've ever had, and I've had a bunch after moving around a lot in the past 25 years. Good listener, friendly & straightforward. Always presents options and takes a "let's try the least extreme course" first. Office staff has improved tremendously since Dr. Johnson left. Highest recommendation.
