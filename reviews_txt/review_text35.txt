Good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. 

Doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol. 

Their wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. 
Offers a quick lunch.
