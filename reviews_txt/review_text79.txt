My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.
