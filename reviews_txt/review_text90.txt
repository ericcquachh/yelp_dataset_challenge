Yum - freaking - me!

As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:

- Don't eat early in the week 
- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave


 I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.

My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.

Food - 

The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     

Portion -

This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.

Service - 

My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.

Price - 

The cost ranges $5 - 10.


I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.
